  "Real-browser E2E proof for kami-ongaku-notation: proves the repo's real,
   unit-tested score/notation data (pitch, exact-rational duration,
   dynamics) -- AFTER a genuine MusicXML export/import round trip through
   this repo's own kami.ongaku.notation.musicxml -- correctly drives real
   audio output once combined with kotoba-lang/audio's real oscillator +
   ADSR DSP via kotoba-lang/org-w3-webaudio's proven AudioWorkletProcessor
   path (org-w3-webaudio commit e554d853d640, reused verbatim per
   kami-ongaku-sampler's own precedent -- not rediscovered).

   The phrase (test/e2e/src/kami/ongaku/notation/e2e/fixture.cljc, required
   UNMODIFIED here and by the worklet bundle): C4 quarter (pp), E4 eighth
   (mf), G4 eighth (mf), C5 half (ff), one 4/4 measure at 120 BPM -- 4
   distinct pitches, 3 distinct duration values, dynamics spanning pp..ff.

   This script:
     1. requires kami.ongaku.notation.e2e.fixture directly (nbb, no browser) and
        checks `measure-valid?` (the phrase's own durations really do sum
        to the 4/4 capacity, via this repo's real validate/validate-part).
     2. round-trips the score through this repo's REAL MusicXML export
        (`score->musicxml`) and import (`musicxml->score`) and asserts the
        result is structurally identical to the original (a genuine XML
        codec exercise, not skipped).
     3. computes playback params (freq/gain/onset/dur-samples) BOTH from
        the pre-round-trip notes and the post-round-trip notes (same
        fixture functions) and asserts they're identical -- proving the
        round trip didn't corrupt the data that drives audio.
     4. computes an offline reference PCM buffer directly from
        kotoba-lang/audio's audio.synth (same DSP the worklet uses), here,
        with NO browser involved, as ground truth.
     5. compiles+runs (via test/e2e/src/kami/ongaku/notation/e2e/{worklet_dsp,
        main_driver}.cljs, scripts/build-e2e-bundles.sh) a real headless
        Chromium (Playwright) rendering the WHOLE phrase in ONE
        OfflineAudioContext / AudioWorkletProcessor pass (not 4 separate
        single-note renders), and captures the actual PCM.
     6. diffs captured vs. offline-reference PCM over the WHOLE buffer
        (the strongest, least-forgeable correctness signal: any wrong
        onset/frequency/gain anywhere shows up as a large diff somewhere).
     7. for each note, MEASURES (from the captured PCM, not merely
        asserting the inputs were correct):
          a. actual onset sample position (first sample, scanning forward
             from the note's expected onset, whose magnitude crosses 5% of
             that note's own expected gain -- normalizes the threshold
             across pp/mf/ff so it isn't biased toward louder notes)
             against the expected (rational-duration-derived) onset;
          b. actual frequency via interpolated positive-going zero-crossing
             timing over the note's steady-state window (attack+decay
             done, release not yet started) -- the same technique
             kami-ongaku-sampler's own run_e2e.cljs uses;
          c. peak |amplitude| in that note's steady-state window -- to
             show, numerically, that the ff note's peak is clearly greater
             than the pp note's (not merely that a gain number was
             computed).

   Requires: `bash scripts/build-e2e-bundles.sh` run first, `npm install`
   inside test/e2e/ for the Playwright dependency, and this repo's own src/
   plus a checkout of kotoba-lang/audio on the nbb classpath:
