(ns kami.ongaku.e2e.fixture
  "Shared, portable (.cljc — JVM + cljs, required UNMODIFIED by both the
   real-browser worklet bundle and the offline nbb cross-check) fixture for
   kami-ongaku-notation's real-browser AudioWorklet phrase proof (see
   test/e2e/run_e2e.cljs and README, 'Real-browser AudioWorklet phrase
   proof').

   kami-ongaku-notation has no audio synthesis of its own (out of scope per
   its own README — it's the L3 score/notation data model, not the L2 DSP
   executor). To actually *hear* that its pitch/duration/dynamics data
   drives correct audio, this fixture:

     1. builds a real kami.ongaku.notation score (this repo's own
        `notation/note`/`measure`/`part`/`score` constructors, not a
        reimplementation) — a 4-note phrase in one 4/4 measure at 120 BPM:
        C4 quarter (pp), E4 eighth (mf), G4 eighth (mf), C5 half (ff).
        Durations sum to exactly 1 whole note (1/4+1/8+1/8+1/2 = 1), so the
        phrase is itself a real, `validate/validate-part`-clean measure —
        not just a bag of notes.
     2. round-trips it through this repo's OWN MusicXML export/import
        (`kami.ongaku.notation.musicxml/score->musicxml` +
        `musicxml->score`) and asserts the result is structurally identical
        to the original score (a real XML-codec round trip, not skipped).
     3. converts the (round-tripped) notes to playback parameters using
        ONLY this repo's own functions plus the standard formulas the task
        requires cross-checking:
          - pitch -> frequency: standard equal-temperament formula,
            freq = 440 * 2^((midi-69)/12), where `midi` comes from this
            repo's OWN `kami.ongaku.notation.pitch/pitch->midi` (verified
            against pitch.cljc directly: A4 -> midi 69, C4 -> midi 60,
            (* 12 (inc octave)) + step->semitone + alter, i.e. C4 = 12*5+0+0
            = 60, A4 = 12*5+9+0 = 69 — the standard convention).
          - duration -> sample count: uses `notation/duration-value`'s
            EXACT kami.ongaku.notation.rational fraction of a whole note,
            converted to a sample count via rational arithmetic ONLY
            (rational * 4 [quarters/whole] * rational(60/BPM) [seconds/
            quarter] * rational(SR) [samples/second]) — no float division
            happens until `rational/->int` extracts the final (exact, in
            this fixture's chosen BPM/SR) integer sample count. This is the
            reason `kami.ongaku.notation.rational` exists at all (see that
            ns's docstring): this fixture is the point where that
            exactness actually gets used for something audible.
          - dynamics -> gain: this repo's OWN
            `kami.ongaku.notation/dynamic->velocity` (ppp..fff -> MIDI
            velocity 16..127), linearly scaled to a [0,1] gain by /127.0
            (the standard MIDI-velocity-to-linear-gain convention).

   Both the worklet-side bundle (test/e2e/src/kami/ongaku/e2e/worklet_dsp.cljs)
   and test/e2e/run_e2e.cljs (nbb, no browser) require this namespace
   UNMODIFIED, so the phrase/score/conversions the browser renders and the
   ones the offline reference is computed from are provably the same data,
   not two hand-synced copies."
